so the only difference between them is the gender of the schools one is for boys and one is for girls
the only difference that we can see in relation to the two schools is gender
if we do send on the information can this be looked at or can it be appealed
where does this leave the school now
i would welcome a bit more detail
is an absolute waste of time and pure nonsense
who just two years ago ran to the hills at the very thought of going into government
you were going around the country telling people you should be in power
and you're great at telling everyone how to spend money but you're not so good at telling us where to find it
your policies would bankrupt this country and plunge us into recession
it's something i'll never be able to fathom
all of the personal stories and testimonies stating otherwise
these experiences being devalued is inhumane
but the word nursery may disguise the nature of that institution
a total of a hundred and eighty two babies died in this home
issues which plague the irish people like the housing and health receive much talk but very little in the way of actual solutions
huge rises in rent in recent years
that means that many people are paying close to if not more than half their income after tax on rent
our mental health again the government talk a good game but deliver less than they claim
the referrals will be to the charity based organisations and not state provided services
price of food goes up and up and up but so too do retail profits
i'll tell you four things that can be done here and now
to at least freeze prices if they can't actually cut them
introduce an emergency two percent tax on the wealth of every millionaire household in the country
it's not rocket fuel for inflation you're redistributing wealth
the pandemic has also resulted in a profound economic shock across the globe its impact is being felt right across the irish economy including in the agri food sectors
the impact on the public finances is also profound
recognising the primacy of public health concerns but also the need to maintain critical food supply chains
and consumers continue to have access to safe high quality food products
against this background i commend essential workers in the food industry
this is a good time to take stock of the past two years
fundamentally this is a debate between those who believe in tackling problems and those who believe in exploiting them
ireland is a modern diverse and dynamic country
the two most urgent crises we faced were a historic pandemic and the fasted moving recession ever recorded
it was a time of deep uncertainty and much fear
in my lifetime I've seen a total transformation of Irish agriculture and the consequences for farmers in our wider communities
questions like why is the agri food sector constantly moving in an unsustainable direction
so change can only come about where there is a political will to do so
it's no coincedence that these clusters are in the mega industrialized segment of the agri food sector
the bigger more fundamental problems that have led to this one
households are facing the choice between putting food on the table buying back to school clothes or heating their home
with people including working families skipping meals
the state is not supporting them but letting them fall through the cracks
those cracks are getting wider and wider
your government has repeatedly ruled out measures to support households
corporation tax figures at the moment are doing very very well
in relation to why I made the decision that I did
my view would have been to change it in the way that deputy doherty is advocating
but I believed this change needed to be made and that's why I made it in last years budget
because it's difficult for me to be very accurate
everyone realises that we're in the grips of a series of crises that have rocked the world
we are mercifully far from that reality
i think the evidence shows that this government has been caring
it's undertaking deep seated reform in many areas that have been left untouched for many years
it's doing so with the caution that these sort of underlying crises imply for our country
i too want to raise the issue of the national maternity hospital
i read the documents that were up last night i see another this morning
concerns around ownership control and governance around the new national maternity hospital remain
the question about ownership the key question that everyone is asking is
if this is public ownership in all but name why don't we just move to public ownership
if i can just very briefly address some of the messing and the nonsense raised there
i do welcome the opportunity to make a contribution
it's needed to avoid blackouts
we're here today debating this legislation as a direct result of failed government policy
when it's pointed out to them they get very sore
let's give this context right
this issue has been delayed for decades
while thousands of people die and rot
this assembly for decades has let communities rot
thousands of people should be alive today if it wasn't for the antiquated laws around drug use
this is very wide ranging legislation
i think the very least that we can expect is that there's clarity about the regulations
from our point of view on this side of the house it's very important that we're aware of actually what the regulations are
there's currently no arrangements for notifying us of that
it's for the general public as well
this report is a welcome report
when you talk about pay what are we paying our members of the defence forces to do
if you live in estonia and your welfare system was shut down due to a cyber attack
we need to have the systems we need to have the resources and we need to have the attention
to ensure that the housing that is going to be built to ensure that the social programs are going to be built
in december twenty nineteen at the social protection committee
these are anti victimization measures that will allow workers to make a complaint to the WRC if they are a victim
this is definitely on the roadmap to progress
i know from people in the film industry that they have been blacklisted
the reason why the committee put forward that the legislation should be brought in within six months
i want to raise this topic because i think it is one of the areas that is going to have the most impact on people living in dublin
there's two aspects to it i want to talk on it on the local and i want to talk on it on the general
there have been public meetings in the constituency
these people live in the area they live on the roads affected and they live on the surrounding roads
i'm in favor of public transport i'm in favour of an enhanced bus service
both agencies are absolutely committed to ongoing implementation of the protocol across the country
that's certainly what we intend to do
in the last two and a half years we've lost three giants of the civil rights movement in ireland
i'll always be grateful to him for encouraging me in my early years of politics
especially when it came to issues like housing
along with the historic structures fund this year's funding for historic structures came to over four million euros
protecting our historic buildings from damage
is an important part of our overall national response
i know that in the twenty twenty built heritage investment scheme
to help increase the resilience of their buildings their historic structures to withstand the constant effects of climate change
i support the government's decision not to oppose the private member's entitled autism bill
you talk to housing you talk to education you talk to post primary education higher education
while a lot of people and a lot of government's might have talked of it this government is actually doing it
transitioning through into higher education out into employment
the individuals themselves they actually shape the strategy
we are here today because of the outrage the upset and the lack of trust
there has been no debate or little on this other than what was forced by opposition
we have committed people on the ground who have been demonised
so let me go around in a circle
fast forward four ministers later no colocation anymore complete integration
and it is important this process be allowed to conclude to inform the decision that will be taken
i welcome the opportunity to update deputies regarding the progress of those engagements to date
i am very keen to lean on the wisdom of all in the education sector
it is important i believe to hear and understand all voices and perspectives
the advisory group includes representatives of students parents teachers and school leaders
if you've ever studied as i have and i'm sure you have the faces of people in a crowd
who may be fearful for whatever reason it may be
i think it's important that we do speak
they're entitled to go about their lives
the biggest single one over the last twenty years was the war in rwanda
the full range of health options for women would ever be safeguarded
to turn a blind eye to women's rights
everyone i speak to is baffled as to why we can't own the land and the hospital
we've had lots of talk about this transaction being compared to buying an apartment
from ten euro a year to over a quarter of a billion euro over the lifetime of a lease
to officially put on the record the facts relating to an incident that took place four years ago
the penalty for my offense was a two hundred euro fine and a three month driving ban
i am conscious that a constant drip feed of new information can be damaging and destabilising
the emergence of this issue into the public domain
i want to assure the house that i will now invest my full energy my full focus on the responsibility i've been given
a war on the borders of the european union and in cyber space a war on a sovereign state and a war on democracy itself is starting to play out
we need to be prepared and i'm sad to say it for a humanitarian crisis
but we do have control over our preparation and our response
we must avoid misinformation and polarisation on the critical issues of our day
with true and effective solidarity and unity i don't believe that he will succeed
it is important that the objectives of the bill can be delivered
officials of the department of enterprise trade and employment will also engage with the health and safety authority
to determine the best mechanisms for the delivery of the objectives of the bill
when it comes to working together to deal with covid nineteen in the workplace
i would like to stress to deputy murphy that we are not starting from scratch here
making measures such as ventilation and air filtration critical
this is of extreme importance currently in our school communities
many classrooms don't have adequate ventilation and some classrooms don't even have windows
children and teaching staff are freezing
it shouldn't be like this
the lack of planning and consideration regarding the needs of older more vulnerable people contributed to in no small way to this tragic loss of life
the dail is spending time talking about introducing a law that would sanction the ending of people's lives
using terms like very restricted bills with lots of safeguards doesn't make it so
having good intentions is not good enough in this situation
we have a suicide crisis in ireland at present
we're hurling headlong into an accommodation crisis
it's the biggest barrier to third level education today
many end up having to commute extraordinary distances
delivering genuinely affordable accommodation for students
so we need to look at the figures and we need to be honest with people and we need to deal with this
the many strands of her cruelly short life were brought together yesterday
i think we see in our own lives moments which are so familiar to all of us
and as women we see ourselves
a mixture of emotions shock disbelief anger upset and a determination
we must all work together to achieve a shared goal of zero tolerance of violence and abuse against women
pieces of legislation or a bill or some ideas
and like the approach to jobs the action plan for jobs there's action by action list by list that has to be carried out
i've not seen a full whole complete plan by anybody
i accept you've different ideas as well
come with a full plan if you really want to scrap ours if you think ours is not working as well
during the last general election the people sent a very clear message to government in relation to pension age
the pension age clearly matters to people
that pressure in the last general election forced this government into a significant u turn
we would have people who spend almost every day on their feet
and you spoke earlier on about income adequacy
i think people recognise that decisions taken at a european council impact significantly on their lives
we're maturing as a country in our relationship with the eu
the benefits and the challenges of eu membership
the eu makes lots of mistakes it gets stuff wrong
food and energy security top the list
at the beginning of the covid nineteen crisis when all of us were faced with the uncertainty of what lay ahead
unfortunately since the start of the crisis there's been a lack of clarity initially regarding
however many other serious concerns remain
the larger challenges faced in the sector have not been addressed
as part of the government's roadmap for reopening ireland
i've listened closely to what has been said this evening
to ensure developments and improvements in the delivery of our child and youth mental health services
protecting the mental health of all our population including young people has never been more critical
fundamental reforms are needed in many areas of mental health services
our services failed our children and young people
the government tax take is ninety six point five eight cents
and that again may be higher in parts of the country
the reductions that you're reporting today are not reductions at all
the tax that's on the tax on a litre of petrol
that's the twenty cent reduction we're supposed to be getting
it is very difficult to overstate the significace of what is actually happening in ukraine
the potential for a devastating conflict is unfortunately very real
the un resolution specifically calls on all states
i've also met with the russian ambassador
and i believe that ireland has a role to play in the international arena
