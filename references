so the only difference between them is the gender of the schools one is for boys and one is for girls
the only difference that we can see in relation to the two schools is gender
if we do send on the information can this be looked at or can it be appealed
where does this leave the school now
i would welcome a bit more detail
is an absolute waste of time and pure nonsense
who just two years ago ran to the hills at the very thought of going into government
you were going around the country telling people you should be in power
and you're great at telling everyone how to spend money but you're not so good at telling us where to find it
your policies would bankrupt this country and plunge us into recession
it's something i'll never be able to fathom
all of the personal stories and testimonies stating otherwise
these experiences being devalued is inhumane
but the word nursery may disguise the nature of that institution
a total of a hundred and eighty two babies died in this home
issues which plague the irish people like the housing and health receive much talk but very little in the way of actual solutions
huge rises in rent in recent years
that means that many people are paying close to if not more than half their income after tax on rent
our mental health again the government talk a good game but deliver less than they claim
the referrals will be to the charity based organisations and not state provided services
price of food goes up and up and up but so too do retail profits
i'll tell you four things that can be done here and now
to at least freeze prices if they can't actually cut them
introduce an emergency two percent tax on the wealth of every millionaire household in the country
it's not rocket fuel for inflation you're redistributing wealth
the pandemic has also resulted in a profound economic shock across the globe its impact is being felt right across the irish economy including in the agri food sectors
the impact on the public finances is also profound
recognising the primacy of public health concerns but also the need to maintain critical food supply chains
and consumers continue to have access to safe high quality food products
against this background i commend essential workers in the food industry
this is a good time to take stock of the past two years
fundamentally this is a debate between those who believe in tackling problems and those who believe in exploiting them
ireland is a modern diverse and dynamic country
the two most urgent crises we faced were a historic pandemic and the fasted moving recession ever recorded
it was a time of deep uncertainty and much fear
in my lifetime I've seen a total transformation of Irish agriculture and the consequences for farmers in our wider communities
questions like why is the agri food sector constantly moving in an unsustainable direction
so change can only come about where there is a political will to do so
it's no coincedence that these clusters are in the mega industrialized segment of the agri food sector
the bigger more fundamental problems that have led to this one
households are facing the choice between putting food on the table buying back to school clothes or heating their home
with people including working families skipping meals
the state is not supporting them but letting them fall through the cracks
those cracks are getting wider and wider
your government has repeatedly ruled out measures to support households
corporation tax figures at the moment are doing very very well
in relation to why I made the decision that I did
my view would have been to change it in the way that deputy doherty is advocating
but I believed this change needed to be made and that's why I made it in last years budget
because it's difficult for me to be very accurate
everyone realises that we're in the grips of a series of crises that have rocked the world
we are mercifully far from that reality
i think the evidence shows that this government has been caring
it's undertaking deep seated reform in many areas that have been left untouched for many years
it's doing so with the caution that these sort of underlying crises imply for our country
i too want to raise the issue of the national maternity hospital
i read the documents that were up last night i see another this morning
concerns around ownership control and governance around the new national maternity hospital remain
the question about ownership the key question that everyone is asking is
if this is public ownership in all but name why don't we just move to public ownership
if i can just very briefly address some of the messing and the nonsense raised there
i do welcome the opportunity to make a contribution
it's needed to avoid blackouts
we're here today debating this legislation as a direct result of failed government policy
when it's pointed out to them they get very sore
let's give this context right
this issue has been delayed for decades
while thousands of people die and rot
this assembly for decades has let communities rot
thousands of people should be alive today if it wasn't for the antiquated laws around drug use
this is very wide ranging legislation
i think the very least that we can expect is that there's clarity about the regulations
from our point of view on this side of the house it's very important that we're aware of actually what the regulations are
there's currently no arrangements for notifying us of that
it's for the general public as well
this report is a welcome report
when you talk about pay what are we paying our members of the defence forces to do
if you live in estonia and your welfare system was shut down due to a cyber attack
we need to have the systems we need to have the resources and we need to have the attention
to ensure that the housing that is going to be built to ensure that the social programs are going to be built
in december twenty nineteen at the social protection committee
